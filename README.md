## About The Project

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for an innovative mobile application that enhances your audio playback experience by automatically stopping audio when you fall asleep. Whether you enjoy listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks before bed, this app intelligently detects your sleep patterns and ensures that you don't miss a beat.

## Features

- Intelligent Sleep Detection: The app utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze your sleep patterns and determine when you have fallen asleep. It takes into account factors such as movement, sound, and ambient light to accurately detect your sleep state.

- Seamless Integration: Compatible with popular audio streaming platforms and media players, the app seamlessly integrates with your favorite audio apps. It runs in the background, monitoring your sleep patterns without interfering with your audio playback.

- Customizable Sleep Settings: Tailor the app's behavior to your preferences with customizable sleep settings. You can choose the duration of inactivity before audio playback stops, adjust sensitivity levels for sleep detection, and configure other preferences to suit your needs.

- Smart Wake-Up Feature: To enhance your wake-up experience, the app also includes a smart wake-up feature. Based on your sleep patterns, it determines the optimal time to gently fade in audio, allowing you to wake up to your favorite sounds gradually.

- Sleep Insights and Analytics: Gain valuable insights into your sleep patterns with detailed analytics and visualizations. The app provides sleep duration statistics and trends, helping you understand your sleep quality over time.

- Minimal Battery Impact: The app is designed to have minimal impact on your device's battery life. It intelligently manages resources and optimizes power consumption to ensure an efficient and reliable experience.
